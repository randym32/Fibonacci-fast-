# Fibonacci (fast)
Computing a Fibonacci number is a standard exercise to teach students about recursion.

However, go to the next step... and teach students how to compute a Fibonacci number /fast/.
(The same is true for factorials!)
This is a pity, as the exercise is an excellent springboard for understanding many issues related to algorithms
and computation.

This code shows the simple next step on computing Fibonacci numbers "fast" -- with O(log n) time.
It is relatively straightboard to adapt this to use a multi-precision format for numbers and compute
arbitrarily large numbers.  (The code for performing multiplication and addition for these formats is a bit
longer, so that will go into another repository... if ever.)
